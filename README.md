# removedupsdemo
Simple maven program to take integer array and remove dups with junit tests.

Takes an int[] and returns an int[] with dups removed.
I'm testing conditions with junit tests.

In this code, I decided to internally use an ArrayList<Integer> to store
the result and convert that back to an int[] so I did not have to deal with 
the arry fixed size and values set to "0"
